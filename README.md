# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hello there! I'm a UG (Undergraduate) student, and I'm delighted to share my GitHub repositories with you. Here's a glimpse of what I do and what I'm interested in:

## 1. sales-prediction (Public)
In this repository, I've implemented basic regression using different models and compared their performance. You can explore the Jupyter Notebook to delve into the details of the models and their analysis.

## 2. titanic-dataset-ML (Public)
Here, I've tested several different machine learning models on the Titanic dataset and posted my solution on Kaggle. Take a look at the Jupyter Notebook to see how I approached the problem and evaluated the models.

## 3. java-basics (Public)
In this repository, you'll find fundamental concepts of Java programming. It covers the basics and provides examples to help you grasp the concepts effectively.

## 4. Kaggle-Challenge-Jun25 (Public)
I attempted a Kaggle challenge and documented my progress in this repository. The Jupyter Notebook showcases my approach and insights gained from the challenge.

## 5. Parking-Assist (Public)
Here, I've developed a Parking Assist application using Yolov4, an object detection algorithm. The Python code in this repository assists drivers in parking their vehicles safely.

## 6. Gauss-Seidel-Method-Python (Public)
This repository contains a Python script that performs Gauss-Seidel iterations. The script is used to solve linear equations iteratively. Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook for implementation details and usage examples.

## 7. React-Native-Beginner-Practice (Public)
During my journey of learning React Native, I created practice files, which you can find in this repository. The TypeScript code offers insights into my early experiences with React Native development.

## 8. AndrewNG-SupervisedML (Public)
In this repository, I've compiled lab files and notes from AndrewNG's Machine Learning first course. The Jupyter Notebook contains exercises and implementations from the course.

## 9. distance-estimation-yolov4 (Private)
This repository focuses on distance estimation using Yolov4. As it is set to private, access is restricted to specific individuals.

These are just a few of the repositories on my GitHub profile. I have explored diverse topics, ranging from machine learning and programming languages to web development and automation. Feel free to explore the repositories to gain a better understanding of my interests and skills.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or collaboration opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm always open to engaging with the GitHub community.

Thank you for visiting my profile!

Best regards,
